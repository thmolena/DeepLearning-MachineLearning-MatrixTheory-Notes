        <strong>Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM).
            </strong>
        Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) is a technique used in the field of nonlinear model reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional nonlinear systems. DEIM reduces the computational complexity of such systems by creating a lower-dimensional approximation that retains the essential dynamics of the original model. It works by constructing an empirical basis for the nonlinear terms and then projecting these terms onto a reduced space. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where direct simulation of the full model is computationally prohibitive, allowing for faster and more efficient analyses while preserving the accuracy of the system's behavior. DEIM is commonly applied in engineering and scientific computing, where it facilitates real-time simulations and optimizations of complex systems.
